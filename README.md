Hi lovely fellow community members! 

We would like to start a project to build a Digital Identity solution for the LCU Community.

It will be an experiment to learn from and if possible will be used as an experiment at Lisk Center Utrecht. 

What? - Build a digital identity solution for the LCU Community :hammer: 

why?  - To learn, to experiment with, and because we can! 

Projectteam:
It is an open call. So everybody who likes to join can join. 

If you would like to take up a certain part of the project just let us know and we will put your name to the job.
